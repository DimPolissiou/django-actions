django-actions
==============

A small and simple application which would help you to implement actions similar to **django.contrib.admin** case for your custom tasks outside django admin. Also it provides custom form support if you would like to change some data for the queryset instances.

Based on [Django-actions](https://github.com/tarvitz/django-actions)
